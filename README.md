monogame game

## About
This is a game I am creating using monogame and C#. It uses monogame as a framework and is just a fun little project. Also dont ask what it stands for.

## Description
This is a roguelite style game. The player will have to scavenge for loot collecting what they can and attempt to make it back. They will have to inventory manage while upgrading loot to take back. If they return they will store the loot collected and make the necessary upgrades. They will then venture back out going further and trying to collect better gear. The player will walk around the random map dealing with enemies. The enemy AI will try what it can to defeat them. This game has quite a bit of meta progression but meh seems fun. Other games can have less or this will be changed but looks fun. This will really just be something to play when bored.
